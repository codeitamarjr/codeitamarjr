👋 Hey there, I'm **Itamar Junior**!

🎓 Just graduated with a BSc in Computer Science with Honours of Distinction. Which basically means I'm a certified nerd. Now, I can add "BSc" to my "BS"!

🎮 Gamer: Legend has it, I can code and game at the same time. I've only crashed my computer...several times.

📷 Photographer: My Instagram is full of pictures of my computer setup and occasional sunsets.

💰 Rich and Gorgeous: And if you believe that, I have a piece of the moon to sell you. (Not financial advice, I'm a computer scientist, not a financial advisor)

😆 A Bit of a Liar: Well, you've read this far, haven't you?
