### Java 2D Gaming

I recently developed a small 2D game project using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. This project provided valuable hands-on experience in utilizing object-oriented programming concepts such as abstract classes, properties, and inheritances, as well as creating animations within the HTML5 canvas. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience, enhancing my skills in web development and game design.
